# Hi, I'm Ashmit! ðŸ˜„

I'm just a boy still studying at school. I love to code and create new ideas (i guess?). Tbh, I'm not *that* good at studies. But I *am* good at coding! Besides coding, I also love math and robotics. All these subjects really come together! I should get going cos I have a lot to do! **Bye! ðŸ‘‹**
